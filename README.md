Weather Prediction üå¶Ô∏è

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions using machine learning techniques.
The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, and used to train models that can forecast weather patterns.
It applies feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building with algorithms like regression and classification.
Evaluation metrics are included to measure model accuracy and performance.
The notebook demonstrates a step-by-step process, making it beginner-friendly for understanding weather prediction with Python.
